# READMEs (WIP):
We are still in alpha so docs aren't the priority yet.

## * [Graph](./docs/Graph.md)
## * [Service](./docs/Service.md)
## * [Router](./docs//Router.md)

This is the new Brains@Play core, which seeks to be a true graph based programming api and unified interface for microservices and otherwise automating major frontend and backend execution needs with minimal mental work (once you learn the basics).
